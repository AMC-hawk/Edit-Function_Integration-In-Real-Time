# Edit_Button
Here, I have written the code to integrate a edit button into a basic database table which would retrieve the data of the row we want to edit and store the data into the edit module which would ease the process of editing any particular row.  I was finding solution for the same over the internet but was exhausted going through those not so exciting videos! So i have reduced your work load by just making it available on one click!
